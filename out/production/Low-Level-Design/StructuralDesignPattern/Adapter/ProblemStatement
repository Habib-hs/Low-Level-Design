Scenario:
Imagine Bangladesh Bank needs daily reports on foreign currency transactions from two local banks: City Bank and Dutch-Bangla Bank.
To capture the data, Bangladesh Bank requires all reports in a standardized JSON format.

However, each bank provides this data in a different format:
Dutch-Bangla Bank provides a CSV file with transaction details.
City Bank provides an Excel file with their transaction details.

Challenge:
Bangladesh Bank's system is designed to only process JSON files. Therefore, it cannot directly use the CSV and EXCEL files provided by
Dutch-Bangla Bank and City Bank.

Solution with Adapter Pattern:
Implement two Adapter classes, one for each bank, that will convert the provided CSV and XML data into the required JSON format.

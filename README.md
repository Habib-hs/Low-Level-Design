# Low-Level Design (LLD) in Java

This repository demonstrates **Low-Level Design (LLD)** patterns and solutions in Java. It focuses on implementing **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral Design Patterns** as well as solving popular design problems often asked in interviews. The goal is to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code for real-world problems using object-oriented principles.

### Features:
- **Design Patterns**: Implementations of **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** design patterns.
- **Problem-Solving**: Solutions to common LLD interview questions, such as:
  - Parking Lot Design
  - Tic-Tac-Toe Game
  - Elevator System Design
  - And more...

### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The code examples are written in Java to demonstrate object-oriented design.
